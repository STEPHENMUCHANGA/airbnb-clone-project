### An Application Design and Development Simulating Airbnb Booking Platform 

### Project Overview

#### This is a comprehensive real-world application aimed at designing and developing a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb.
#### It involves a full-stack development focusing on backend systems, database design, API development and application security. 
#### Upon completion, the project will showcase complex architectures, workflow, and teamwork collaboration dynamics in building a scalable web application.

### Project Objectives  
#### Master collaborative team workflow using GitHub
#### Depen backend architecture and database design principles
#### Impliment advanced security measures for API development
#### Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment
#### Strengthen the ability to document and plan complex software projects effectivley 
#### Develop a popular understanding of integrating technologies such as Django, MySQL and GraphQL in unified ecosystem

### Project Goals 
#### The project will ensure the final application has robust achieved user management, property management, booking system, payment processing, review system, and data optimization

### Tech Stack
#### Technologies to be integrated include Django, Django REST framework, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Celery, Redis, Docker, and CI/CD

### Team Roles
